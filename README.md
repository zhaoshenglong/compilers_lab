# Tiger Compiler Labs in C++

## Introduction

## lab1

lab1 is easy. You only need to write a strait-line expression parser. 

### Related chapters

* `Chapter 1`.

## lab2 

lab2 is easy too. You need to add code in `tiger.lex`.<br/>
The only potential difficulty is the parse of `escape string`. There is a very smart and simple solution but I did not apply it in my implementation in that I do not know about is exactly. It is better for you to reference `ASCII Table`, and you will find that `escape strings` can compute by `ord(<S>) - ord(A) + 1`.


### Related chapters

* `Chapter 2`
* `Tiger reference handout`

## lab3

lab3 is like lab2, you only need to tell the `yacc` your rule defined to tiger.<br/>
The difference is than it is difficult than lab3, if you have not read about corresponding chapters. You need not only read through `chapter3` but also `chapter 4`. `Chapter 4` contains all the interface you need to complete. When I was doing this lab, I did not know this so I have to spend much time understanding `absync`.

In this lab, you may need to debug for some time and you aim is to remove `reduce-reduce` in your program and reduce `reduce-shift`.

### Related chapters

* `chapter 3`
* `chapter 4`


## lab4

lab4 is the last lab that already provide you the whole structure. You only need to complete code of each function. 

### Related chapters

* `chapter 5`


## lab5

lab5 is much more difficult than any labs that I do in ics, cse etc. It contains many modules that you need to design and coordinate. <br/>

For me, I do not understand frame at first. I thought it as runtime stack, but in out design, frame is the static layout of one function. <br/>

Here are some notes that I think important.

* One frame for one function.
* Frame contains all the arguments in it and we access arguments with interface provided by `Class Frame`. To do that, we need to do `view shift` for each frame. Which
  means you need to `allocLocal` for each argument in `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`...`rsp + wordsize`, `rsp + 2*wordsize`...

* `rdi`, `rsi` and other registers is implemented in `TEMP::Temp`, the only differece is that they are static, and whenever you need to access them, you should access with interface provided by `Class Frame`.
* `procEntryExit1`, `procEntryExit2`, `procEntryExit3` is the function for a frame layout.
  * In `procEntryExit1`, you should save Escape arguments, save callee registers, execute body statement, restore callee registers. All these are `T::Statement` which is implemented in `T` namespace.
  * In `procEntryExit2`, you need to add an empty instr at the end of frame. The reason for this is that it makes `RV`, `SP`, `CalleeSaves` live out in each frame and you do not need to consider any thing about it in lab5.
  * In `procEntryExit3`, you need to manipulate `SP`. You `subq $framesize, %rsp` at the beginning of frame, and `addq $framesize, %rsp` at the end of each frame. If you implement the case in which arguments are more than 6, you should manage `rsp` here for the truth arguments are at the end of frame.
* In `codegen`, string reference is implemented with instruction `leaq label(%rip), <reg>`.
* In `codegen`, `%rbp` should be replaced with `framesize(%rsp)`.
* You also need to implement a naive register allocation in this lab. In my implementation, I use `r10` and `r11` in that they are caller saves.

## lab6

Since you have already solved `lab5`, `lab6` is easier. You need to do `escape analysis`, `liveness analysis`, `register allocation`. <br/>

Notes are below.

* `Escape analysis` is like `Translate` or `SemanAnalysis`, you could implemented in c-style or make them a method of `Absync`. The latter is much more easier and decent.
* `Liveness analysis` is the same as described in `chapter 10`. You first define `def`, `use` for each instruction and produce `flow graph`. Then you should analyse `live in & live out` information for each instruction. Finally, you need to produce interference graph. 
  * The last instruction should be empty. This is produced in `procEntryExit3` and you should add this after codegen.
  * The live out registers for each frame should be `RV`, `SP`, `Callee Saves`.
  * Do not forget `machine registers`. They are mutually interfere with each other.
* `Register allocation` is the most difficult module in this lab. However, thanks to the `pseudocode` in our textbook, it is not too much difficult. In my implementation, all inteface are provided in `RegAlloc` module. Different from the implementation in textbook, I did not split `RegAlloc` and `Color` module. I simply implement the `pseudocode` described in textbook. There are some notes you may remember.
  * worklistmoves, constrainedmoves ..., all these move related sets can not contains duplicate items. For example, `a->b` or `b->a` are the same. The type of each item could be `LIVE::MoveList` or `AS::Instr` like our textbook. You only need to ensure that there are no duplicates.
  * Our `build` function should initial many datasets
    * worklistmoves
    * moveList
    * addEdge
    * initial
    * alias
    * ...

## Bugs in my implementation
1. In `Escape analysis`, I ignored the analysis of arguments in `callExp`.
2. I did not deal with the case in which arguments are more than 6.
3. Some other bugs ... (I don't know where are they, but they must exist.)
